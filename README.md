Hey there, pt user!

Btw, my Medkit skin is based on @silly_jpg's Artstyle, just colorpicked btw. So it's very obv same as for my boombox ^_^

(i sometimes forget my strawpage, i'm sorry if it's late/vsrs)

I'm very comfortable with c+h even if you ask, if i moved away. That means i wasn't really looking, I'd apologized if i d that at times.

<i do take my comfort characters/ships very seriously, i don't like ppl who pick fun of it <b>unless friends</b>. I sometimes do that to my fiction/Otherkins's as yet. 
if you do make fun of them, i'll obnoxiously hide you for like 15 mins for fair warning

phighting and regretevator fans <b>thin ice/iwc</b>, i have bad experiences But i genuinely like some of yall skins tho.

Most-timed i'd been shown as medkit or boombox skins(even the ph! skins or tints) than my other skins, i rarely or barely changed my skins ofc.

[wip]

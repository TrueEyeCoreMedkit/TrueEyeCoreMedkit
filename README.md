Btw, my Medkit skin is based on @silly_jpg's Artstyle, just colorpicked btw. So it's very obv same as for my boombox ^_^

(i sometimes forget my strawpage, i'm sorry if it's late/vsrs)

I'm very comfortable with c+h even if you ask, if i moved away. That means i wasn't really looking, I'd apologized if i d that at times.

i do take my comfort characters/ships very seriously, i just don't like ppl who pick fun of it. I sometimes do that to my fiction/otherkin's as yet.
